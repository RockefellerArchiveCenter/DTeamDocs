# Rockefeller Archive Center Digital Program Mission

The Digital Program facilitates broad and equitable access to and responsible preservation of materials in the RAC's custody by providing technical leadership and expertise to staff in all program areas. We further our work and the archival profession by taking a collaborative, transparent, and standards-based approach, contributing to open-source systems and communities. We engage researchers and staff to understand their needs, prioritize solutions, and produce high-quality and useful tools and services.
