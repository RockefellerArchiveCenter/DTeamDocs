# Rockefeller Archive Center Digital Strategies Mission

The Digital Strategies team leads the ethical application of technology in all aspects of the RAC's work by connecting people to systems and expertise. We develop, implement, and maintain the organizationâ€™s archival systems and digital infrastructure; build capacity through training designed to empower our colleagues; center user perspectives to continually improve the usability and accessibility of our systems and collections; and participate in professional communities to further our work and the archival profession.
