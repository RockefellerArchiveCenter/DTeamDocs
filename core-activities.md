# Core Activities

## Implementation and Decommissioning
We lead strategy for implementation and decommissioning of systems related to archival functions. We evaluate workflows, systems, and processes holistically, with an eye towards removing redundancy and eliminating unnecessary manual intervention so that our colleagues are better able to use their unique skills in acquiring, preserving, and providing access to archival collections.

## User Experience Design
We support and advocate for the usability of archival systems and processes at the RAC by taking a user-centered approach to design and implementation. We strive to improve user experience by engaging users throughout all stages of the implementation and systems lifecycle. We support this work through user research, performing user experience testing, and involving stakeholders throughout the process. We recognize that accessibility is integral to usability, and are committed to ensuring that people with disabilities have access to our systems and content. We look to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (Level AA) as the target standard for meeting this commitment.

## Maintenance
Ongoing maintenance and repair of infrastructure are vital to keeping our systems and processes working smoothly. We provide product ownership for systems which support archival functions at the RAC and we upgrade and update existing tools and applications to ensure their stability and desired functionality. We plan for the long term maintenance of systems and workflows that support key archival duties, including discovery, access and use of archival collections, reference services, processing, accessioning, digital preservation, and digitization.

## Training
We provide training to empower our colleagues in their use of technology, through formal and informal methods such as one-on-one mentoring, workshops and study groups. We are a resource for expertise ranging from the intricacies of programming languages to broader topics such as digital preservation. We seek to learn from our teaching and to build organizational redundancy for expertise; we never want to be the sole owners of knowledge about or experience with digital systems and materials.

## Community Participation and Leadership
We participate in open-source, standards, and maintenance communities in order to help shape them and to improve our ability to support the appraisal, arrangement, description, preservation and access of analog and digital materials. We apply the lessons we learn from these communities to our work every day.
