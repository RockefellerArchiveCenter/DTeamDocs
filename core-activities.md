# Core Activities

## Implement, Develop and Decommission Systems
We lead strategy for the selection, implementation, and decommissioning of systems key to archival functions. Evaluating workflows, systems, and processes holistically, we try to remove redundancy and eliminate unnecessary manual intervention so that our colleagues are better able to use their unique skills in acquiring, preserving, and providing access to archival collections. In collaboration with the IT team, we contribute to technology initiatives which impact the whole organization.. We develop systems that fit the RAC's needs and use cases, and we are committed to working with open source applications and their communities whenever possible.

## Improve User Experience
We advocate for and improve the usability of archival systems and processes at the RAC by taking a user-centered approach to design and implementation. We perform user research, create and lead user experience tests, and involve stakeholders throughout the design process. Because we recognize that accessibility is integral to usability, we are committed to ensuring that people with disabilities have access to our systems and content.

## Maintain Technical Infrastructure
Ongoing maintenance and repair of infrastructure are vital to keeping our systems and processes working smoothly. We identify breakdowns in our systems infrastructure and implement solutions to provide for their continued use. In addition, we provide product ownership for systems which support archival functions at the RAC. We plan for the long term maintenance of systems and workflows that support key archival duties - including discovery, access and use of archival collections, reference services, processing, accessioning, digital preservation, and digitization - by managing upgrades and updates for existing tools and applications to ensure their stability and desired functionality.

## Develop and Provide Training
Using a variety of methods and techniques, we provide training to empower our colleagues in their use of technology across a wide range of skillsets and topics., We identify gaps in knowledge as well as resources to fill those gaps. Our teaching is designed to help us continue to learn and build organizational capacity and redundancy for expertise. We never want to be the sole owners of knowledge about or experience with digital systems materials. As needed, we train staff from donor organizations in using RAC systems which support the transfer, management, and preservation of digital records.

## Participate in Professional Communities
We actively participate in our profession, particularly in the open-source, standards, and maintenance communities, in order to help shape them and to improve our ability to support the appraisal, arrangement, description, preservation, and access of analog and digital materials. We apply the lessons we learn from these communities to our work every day. Additionally, we communicate about our work via the RAC blog and collaborate with Research and Education in the writing of stories and features for RE:Source storytelling platform.
