# Core Activities

## Implement, Develop and Decommission Systems
We lead strategy for the selection, implementation, and decommissioning of systems key to archival functions. Evaluating workflows, systems, and processes holistically, we try to remove redundancy and eliminate unnecessary manual intervention so that our colleagues are better able to use their unique skills in acquiring, preserving, and providing access to archival collections. We develop systems that fit the RAC's needs and use cases, and also work with open source applications and their communities.

## Design for User Experience
We advocate for and improve the usability of archival systems and processes at the RAC by taking a user-centered approach to design and implementation, striving to improve user experience by engaging users throughout all stages of the systems lifecycle. We perform user research, create and lead user experience tests, and involve stakeholders throughout the design process. Because we recognize that accessibility is integral to usability, we are committed to ensuring that people with disabilities have access to our systems and content.

## Maintain Technical Infrastructure
Ongoing maintenance and repair of infrastructure are vital to keeping our systems and processes working smoothly. We identify breakdowns in our systems infrastructure and implement solutions to provide for their continued use. In addition, we provide product ownership for systems which support archival functions at the RAC.  We plan for the long term maintenance of systems and workflows that support key archival duties - including discovery, access and use of archival collections, reference services, processing, accessioning, digital preservation, and digitization - by managing upgrades and updates for existing tools and applications to ensure their stability and desired functionality.

## Develop and Provide Training
We provide training to empower our colleagues in their use of technology, through a variety of methods - such as one-on-one mentoring, workshops and study groups - and across a range of topics, from the intricacies of programming languages to broader topics such as digital preservation. We identify gaps in knowledge as well as resources to fill those gaps. Our teaching is designed to help us continue to learn and build organizational capacity and redundancy for expertise. We never want to be the sole owners of knowledge about or experience with digital systems and materials.

## Participate in Professional Communities
We participate in open-source, standards, and maintenance communities in order to help shape them and to improve our ability to support the appraisal, arrangement, description, preservation and access of analog and digital materials. We apply the lessons we learn from these communities to our work every day.
