# Rockefeller Archive Center Digital Strategies Team Values

The values of the Rockefeller Archive Center's Digital Program inform how we work together as a team, as well as how we interact with our RAC colleagues, researchers, donors, and other external partners. They support and shape our strategic goals and provide a standard by which we measure our daily work. These values are based in an understanding of technologies as embedded in and shaped by human biases, histories of oppression, and power. Consequently, our values exist to make us _a part of_ a community of practice that engages technology from a basis of values and care, not to set us _apart from_ our colleagues, researchers, donors, or other external partners.

We review our values on an annual basis and revise them as necessary.

## Engage and empower users.

We engage directly with multiple user communities - including researchers, donors, and our colleagues at the RAC - to understand their needs, prioritize solutions, and provide high-quality and useful services and products. In every aspect of our work, we are committed to providing the care, resources, and training necessary to empower users as they interact with systems. As a result, we aspire to approach our work with empathy and humility: listening before solving, valuing the labor and expertise of others, and recognizing that we still have room to learn.

## Provide ethical access
### Respect researchers' privacy.

We advocate for our researchers' right to privacy and confidentiality in both on-site and remote research environments, and that advocacy includes promoting and understanding the role of usability and accessibility in enabling self-determination. When implementing systems, we seek to minimize the amount of user data gathered and stored, and provide mechanisms to facilitate sensible data retention policies.

### Support broad and equitable access to archival materials.

As a team, we develop and support systems and processes that enable researchers to discover, evaluate, and retrieve archival materials using a multiplicity of research methodologies. We promote a more inclusive researcher community and accessible research experience by supporting efficient archival processing, open access by default, clear and transparent use policies, and a user experience guided by the principles of universal design.

## Collaborate
### Build networks, not silos.

Our work looks to break down silos between people, departments, and institutions. We prioritize open-source systems that maximize interoperability through the use of open, community-maintained standards and harness our colleagues' unique skills and expertise by seeking out opportunities for collaboration. Recognizing that information work and infrastructure maintenance are often devalued and invisible, we practice care for ourselves and our colleagues by valuing that labor.

### Practice intentional communication.

When working with our colleagues, external stakeholders, or each other, we always start by listening and move towards collective action. We create safe spaces in which ideas are heard and understood with intentionality, and take concrete actions to respond to feedback promptly.

## Create a culture of learning
### Learn constantly by taking strategic risks.

Recognizing that fear of failure and the unknown can be a barrier to learning, we seek instead to accept the inevitability of failure, minimize its negative effects, and use it as an opportunity to learn. We prefer to implement series of small, iterative, and testable changes to systems and workflows, and take informed risks using safety nets like version control and backups to reduce downtime.

### Invest in yourself and the profession.

We believe that all parts of the archival enterprise are connected, and that we therefore rely on our colleagues' skills, knowledge, and advocacy just as they rely on ours. We are committed to developing our individual expertise, and then sharing it with others through contributions to documentation, forums, presentations, publications, and professional organizations. Throughout this process, we seek to build community by promoting the broad dissemination of knowledge and collective skill-sharing through any means available. We advocate for ethical labor practices, and challenge hierarchical models that harm the community by reproducing contingency and precarity.
