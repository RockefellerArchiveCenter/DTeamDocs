D-Team Values

Don’t let the perfect defeat the good.
Strive for excellence, but don’t let the pursuit of perfection intimidate or immobilize your efforts. Focus on creating a workable solution that can be tested and improved. 

Make and promote continuous and incremental change.
Making small, iterative changes allows us to test the outcomes of those changes, and then revise our approach accordingly.

Focus on the user.
Engage with users to understand their needs, prioritize solutions, and produce outcomes that provide high-quality and useful services for both researchers and RAC staff.

Build networks, not silos.
Work towards building systems that are open and interoperable, leveraging existing open-source standards and tools whenever possible.

Invest in yourself and the profession.
All parts of the archival enterprise are connected; we all rely on each other's skills and knowledge. Develop your expertize and share it with others through documentation, forums, presentations and publications. 

Promote transparent decisions and actions.
Openness in decision-making helps create realistic expectations of our actions and reduces miscommunication over results. Transparency can be achieved by using open software, tools and standards where possible, and by documenting decision-making and prioritization processes.

Practice positive, solution-centered communication.
Create an environment in which ideas and feedback are heard and understood, and responses are provided. The best solutions come from a diverse and collaborative team where conversations are focused on clearly defining a problem, brainstorming solutions, and evaluating outcomes.

Learn constantly by embracing failure.
Test solutions and workflows out before implementation. If a desired outcome isn’t reached, find a solution to get the process back on track. Document what happened to avoid repeating the misstep. It’s okay to break a few eggs.
