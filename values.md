#D-Team Values#

##Don’t let the perfect defeat the good.##
Strive for excellence, but don’t let the pursuit of perfection intimidate or immobilize your efforts. Focus on creating a workable solution that can be tested and improved.

##Focus on the user.##
We serve multiple constituencies and always work for the good of others. Engage with users to understand their needs, prioritize solutions, and produce outcomes that provide high-quality and useful services for both researchers and RAC staff. Provide the resources, training, and support necessary for users to feel empowered to use and troubleshoot our systems.

##Build networks, not silos.##
Work towards building systems that are open and interoperable, leveraging existing open-source standards and tools whenever possible. Work towards human collaboration as well; work together with others to best take advantage of skills and expertise.

##Invest in yourself and the profession.##
All parts of the archival enterprise are connected; we all rely on each other's skills and knowledge. Develop your expertise and share it with others through documentation, forums, presentations and publications. Promote broad dissemination of knowledge through any means available.

##Practice positive, solution-centered communication.##
Create an environment in which ideas and feedback are heard and understood, and responses are provided. The best solutions come from a diverse and collaborative team where conversations are focused on clearly defining a problem, brainstorming solutions, and evaluating outcomes.

##Learn constantly by embracing failure.##
Test solutions and workflows out before implementation. Making small, iterative changes allows us to test the outcomes of those changes, and then revise our approach accordingly. Document what happened to avoid repeating the misstep. It’s okay to break a few eggs.

##Support access to materials.##
Provide researchers access to the highest quality description and materials as possible and enable new scholarship by making materials available as soon as possible.
