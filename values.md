# Rockefeller Archive Center Digital Strategies Team Values

The values of the Rockefeller Archive Center's (RAC) Digital Strategies team inform how we work together, as well as how we interact with our RAC colleagues, researchers, donors, and other external partners. They support and shape our strategic goals and provide a standard by which we measure our daily work and hold ourselves and each other accountable.  

These values are grounded in the belief that technology is a practice that involves both people and machines. As a result, it is embedded in and shaped by human biases, histories of oppression, and power, and often further entrenches intersectional systems of oppression based on race, colonialism, class, gender, sexuality, and disability. We intend to counter oppression delivered through technology.

Our values exist to make us _a part of_ a community of practice that engages technology from a basis of values and care, not to set us _apart from_ our colleagues, researchers, donors, or other external partners.

We review our values on an annual basis and revise them as necessary.

## Engage and empower users.

We engage directly with multiple local and global user communities – including current and potential researchers, donors, and our colleagues at the RAC - to understand their needs, prioritize solutions, and provide high-quality and useful services and products. In every aspect of our work, we are committed to providing the care, resources, and training necessary to empower users as they interact with and create systems. We aim to empower our colleagues to embrace a healthy relationship with technology in their work. As a result, we aspire to approach our work with empathy and humility: acknowledging the diversity of our users and their needs, listening and understanding before solving, amplifying marginalized voices and centering the needs of these individuals and communities, valuing the labor and expertise of others, and recognizing that we always have room to learn.

## Provide ethical access
### Respect researchers' rights to privacy and self-determination.

We advocate for our researchers' right to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination in both on-site and remote research environments. When implementing systems, we seek to minimize the amount of user data gathered and stored, and provide mechanisms to facilitate sensible data retention policies. By improving the usability and accessibility of systems, we promote independent, self-directed access, and improve users’ ability to make choices about their personal data.

### Support broad and equitable access to archival materials.

As a team, we develop and support systems and processes that enable researchers to discover, evaluate, and retrieve archival materials using a multiplicity of research methodologies. We recognize that the histories of exclusion and structural oppression of people with marginalized identities within the archival profession, research spaces, and our collections contribute to access barriers including physical, technological, perceptual, and systemic deterrents. We seek to facilitate the development of an inclusive user community by supporting efficient archival processing, clear and transparent access systems, policies which support broad access and use, and a user experience guided by the principles of universal design.

## Collaborate
### Build networks, not silos.

Our work looks to break down silos between people, departments, institutions, and professions. We prioritize open-source systems that maximize transparency and interoperability through the use of open, community-maintained standards and harness our colleagues' unique skills and expertise by seeking out opportunities for collaboration. We support and advocate for work that broadens technological knowledge across the RAC and positions archivists to become confident technologists. We encourage archivists to take ownership of digital systems and services. Recognizing that information work and infrastructure maintenance are often devalued and invisible, we practice care for ourselves and our colleagues by valuing that labor.

### Practice intentional communication.

When working with our colleagues, external stakeholders, or each other, we always start by listening and move towards collective action. Through the intentional use of generative facilitation methods, we create safe spaces in which ideas are heard and understood and take concrete actions to respond to feedback promptly.

## Create a culture of learning
### Learn constantly by taking strategic risks.

We encourage creativity and experimentation. Recognizing that fear of failure, judgement, and the unknown can be barriers to learning, we seek instead to accept the inevitability of failure, minimize its negative effects, and use it as an opportunity to learn. We prefer to implement series of small, iterative, and testable changes to systems and workflows, and take informed risks using safety nets like version control and backups to reduce downtime.

### Invest in yourself and the profession.

We believe that all parts of the archival enterprise are connected, and that we therefore rely on our colleagues' skills, knowledge, and advocacy just as they rely on ours. We are committed to developing our individual expertise, and then sharing it with others through contributions to documentation, forums, presentations, publications, and professional organizations. Throughout this process, we seek to build community by promoting the broad dissemination of knowledge and collective skill-sharing through any means available. We advocate for ethical labor practices, and challenge hierarchical models that harm the community by reproducing contingency and precarity.
