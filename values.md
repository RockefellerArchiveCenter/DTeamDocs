#D-Team Values#

##Engage and empower users.##
We serve multiple constituencies and always work for the good of others. Engage with users to understand their needs, prioritize solutions, and produce outcomes that provide high-quality and useful services for both researchers and RAC staff. Provide the resources, training, and support necessary for users to feel empowered to use and troubleshoot our systems.

##Build networks, not silos.##
Work towards building systems that are open and interoperable, using open-source standards and tools whenever possible. Collaborate with others to better take advantage of unique skills and expertise.

##Invest in yourself and the profession.##
All parts of the archival enterprise are connected; we all rely on each other's skills and knowledge. Develop your expertise and share it with others through documentation, forums, presentations and publications. Promote broad dissemination of knowledge through any means available.

##Practice positive, solution-centered communication.##
Create an environment in which ideas and feedback are heard and understood, and responses are provided. The best solutions come from a diverse and collaborative team where conversations are focused on clearly defining a problem, brainstorming solutions, and evaluating outcomes.

##Learn constantly by embracing failure.##
Strive for excellence, but donâ€™t let the pursuit of perfection intimidate or immobilize your efforts. Test solutions and workflows out before implementation. Making small, iterative changes allows us to test the outcomes of those changes, and then revise our approach accordingly. Document what happened to avoid repeating the misstep and use safety nets like version control and backups to reduce downtime.

##Support broad and equitable access to archival materials.##
Provide researchers access to the highest quality description and materials as possible and enable new scholarship by making materials available as soon as possible.
