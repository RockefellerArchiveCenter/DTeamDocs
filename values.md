# D-Team Values

## Engage and empower users.

We serve multiple constituencies and always work for the good of others. Engage with users to understand their needs, prioritize solutions, and produce outcomes that provide high-quality and useful services for researchers, donors and RAC staff. Provide the resources, training, and support necessary for users to feel empowered to use and troubleshoot our systems.

## Support broad and equitable access to archival materials.

Create and maintain accurate, complete and structured archival description that all researchers can use to discover, evaluate and retrieve archival materials. Facilitate research and scholarship by eliminating barriers to access including processing delays, unnecessary access restrictions, and complex use policies.

## Build networks, not silos.

Implement systems that are open and interoperable, using open-source standards and tools whenever possible. Collaborate with others to better take advantage of unique skills and expertise.

## Practice positive, solution-centered communication.

Create an environment in which ideas and feedback are heard and understood, and timely responses are provided. The best solutions come from a diverse and collaborative team where conversations are focused on clearly defining a problem, brainstorming solutions, and evaluating outcomes.

## Learn constantly by embracing failure.

Strive for excellence, but donâ€™t let the pursuit of perfection intimidate or immobilize your efforts. Test solutions and workflows out before implementation. Making small, iterative changes allows us to test the outcomes of those changes, and then revise our approach accordingly. Document what happened to avoid repeating the misstep and use safety nets like version control and backups to reduce downtime.

## Invest in yourself and the profession.

All parts of the archival enterprise are connected; we all rely on each other's skills and knowledge. Develop your expertise and share it with others through documentation, forums, presentations and publications. Promote broad dissemination of knowledge through any means available.
